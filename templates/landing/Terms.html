                               Please read these Terms & Conditions (“Terms”, “Agreement”) carefully before using the website https://optimizedleads.in
 (the “Website”) and the services of OptimizedLeads (“we”, “us”, “our”) operated from Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India.

By accessing or using the Website and/or subscribing to our lead-generation services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, you must not use our Website or services.

1. Definitions

“Customer”, “you”, “your” means the individual or entity who subscribes to our services or uses the Website.

“Services” means the lead-generation platform, dashboard, plans, free trial, subscription packages, and any other features made available by OptimizedLeads.

“Leads” means the prospective contacts, clients, or customers generated and delivered by us to you for your business (e.g., real-estate buyer leads, tenant leads, study-abroad student leads, education leads, job-consultancy leads).

“Subscription” means the paid plan (or free trial) you sign-up for via the Website.

“Dashboard” means the online interface provided by us where you access your account, view leads, manage filters, etc.

2. Eligibility

You represent and warrant that you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts and that you are at least 18 years old (or the equivalent legal age in your jurisdiction). If you are registering on behalf of a business, you represent that you are duly authorised to bind that business.

3. Use of the Website & Services

You may use the Website for legitimate business purposes only, i.e., to generate leads in your chosen industry (real-estate, education, study abroad, job consultancy, etc).

You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information when registering an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.

You shall not use the Services for illegal or fraudulent activities, or to send spam, engage in deceptive marketing, or otherwise misuse the leads provided.

4. Subscription, Free Trial & Payment

We may offer a free trial period (for example, a 2-day free trial) with no credit card required. The terms of the free trial will be as defined on the Website at the time of sign-up.

After the free trial (if applicable), you may upgrade to a paid subscription plan. The pricing, features, and number of leads in each plan are as published on our Website (or as communicated to you).

Payment must be made via the methods made available on the Website. You agree to provide valid payment information and authorise us to charge such payment method.

Unless otherwise stated, all subscription fees are non-refundable and non-cancellable after commencement, except as specified under our refund or guarantee policy (see Section 7).

We reserve the right to modify our subscription plans, pricing, or features at any time; such changes will not affect any existing subscription during its current billing term, unless we notify you.

5. Delivery of Leads

Upon activation of your subscription, we will endeavour to deliver verified leads as described in your plan (for example, daily lead delivery, property-type targeting, location-based filtering) as per the Website’s published description.

You understand that lead generation involves inherent uncertainties (e.g., lead responsiveness, conversion probability) and we do not guarantee a specific number of conversions or revenue.

We may offer a “lead replacement guarantee” for leads that do not meet our internal quality standards or are unresponsive, as described on the Website or in your plan. You must comply with our defined process (e.g., reporting within a specified time) to access a replacement.

You are responsible for promptly following up on leads; we are not liable for your business outcomes (e.g., whether you close a deal).

6. Account Termination, Cancellation & Suspension

You may cancel your subscription at any time via your Dashboard or by contacting us; cancellation will become effective at the end of your current billing cycle (unless the plan states otherwise).

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account immediately if you breach these Terms, engage in fraudulent or prohibited activities, or compromise the integrity or security of the Services.

Upon termination or expiry of your account, we may delete or disable access to your data, leads, and Dashboard; you may not be able to retrieve any remaining data after that.

7. Refunds & Guarantees

We may offer a refund policy (for example, a 30-day money-back guarantee) or lead replacement policy as published on the Website. For example: if the leads do not meet our quality standards and you submit a claim in the prescribed time, we may replace leads or refund part of your payment.

To claim any refund or replacement, you must comply with the process, provide requested evidence (e.g., proof of lead non-responsiveness), and submit your request within the time-frame specified.

Except as expressly set out in this section, all payments are final and non-refundable.

8. Intellectual Property

All content, design, graphics, logos, trademarks, software, and other materials on the Website and in connection with the Services are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by copyright, trademark or other intellectual-property laws.

You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to access and use the Website and the Dashboard for your business purposes in accordance with these Terms.

You must not reproduce, distribute, modify, reverse-engineer or otherwise exploit any part of the Website or Services without our prior written consent.

9. User Content & Conduct

If you submit any content (for example, feedback, comments, messages) to our Website or Dashboard, you grant us an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, reproduce, adapt, publish and display such content.

You agree not to use the Website or Services for any harmful, unlawful, defamatory or obscene activities. You must not infringe any third-party rights (privacy, intellectual-property, publicity) or violate any applicable law.

You are responsible for all communications you send to leads; we are not liable for your messages, outreach or follow-up.

10. Limitation of Liability & Disclaimer of Warranties

The Services are provided “as is”, and to the extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied (including merchantability, fitness for purpose, non-infringement).

We do not guarantee that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or that any particular result will be achieved (e.g., number of deals closed).

To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability (whether in contract, tort, negligence or otherwise) in connection with these Terms or the Services shall not exceed the amount you paid to us in the preceding 12 months.

We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special or consequential losses (such as lost profits, business interruption, loss of data) even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

11. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless OptimizedLeads, its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses (including legal fees) arising out of or in connection with (i) your breach of these Terms, (ii) your use of the Services, (iii) your violation of applicable law, or (iv) any activity in your account.

12. Privacy & Data Protection

Your use of the Website and Services is also subject to our Privacy Policy (and any other policies posted on the Website). You consent to our collection, use, storage, and sharing of data as described in that Policy.
You acknowledge that leads provided to you may contain personal data of third parties; you are responsible for complying with applicable data‐protection laws (such as the Indian IT Act, SPDI rules, and any relevant regional laws) and that you will handle such personal data responsibly and securely.

13. Changes to Terms

We may revise these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes (for example by posting an updated version on the Website and updating “Last updated”). Your continued use of the Website or Services after the effective date of any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

14. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India and the courts at Indore, Madhya Pradesh shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Services.

15. Severability & Waiver

If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. No waiver by us of any right under these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by us.
